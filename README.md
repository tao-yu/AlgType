This is an Autohotkey script that allows you to type algorithms using your keyboard with the same controls as Ryan Heise's simulator, Hi-games.net, qcube and jflysim. You can use this anywhere, on speedsolving.com, youtube, alg.cubing.net - anywhere with a text box. (See below for links to learn heise controls)

Only works on windows.

# Features

- Move cancellation for half turns: 
R' R' is cancelled into R2'. (R2 R is not cancelled into R3 or R' though, and R R' is not cancelled).

- All 3x3 moves are supported:
RUFBLDrufbldMESxyzR'U'F'B'L'D'r'u'f'b'l'd'M'E'S'x'y'z' can all be typed. Type lowercase moves using the shift key.

- Shortcuts for commutators and conjugates: 
Ctrl+m inputs "[,]" and Ctrl+j inputs "[:]"
The keyboard shortcut ctrl + space can be used to move on to the next part of the commutator without messing up the spacing. See a demonstration here: http://gfycat.com/GentleSlushyAtlanticblackgoby

- Some other shortcuts: 
ctrl + 9 = "()", ctrl + [ = "[]". These only work when you're in the algorithm typing mode.

- Plays nicely with big cube notation.
Just type the number before the move e.g. 3R, 4r2, 3-4r'
