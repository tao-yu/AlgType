TITLE: New QWERTY to heise autohotkey script. (3x3 reconstruction in 1:38.26!)

Just something I was working on during the summer. I started work on this before I realized that [url="https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?21551-QWERTY-to-Heise-Keyboard-Remapper-(For-Windows)"]Andy Klise[/url] and [url="https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?19762-Heise-Simulator-Keyboard-Layout-(Mac-only)"]Lucas Garron[/url] had done it before. However, I figured I could add a few extra features. I hope some of you will find this useful.

This allows you to type algorithms using your keyboard with the same controls as Ryan Heise's simulator, Hi-games.net, qcube and jflysim. You can use this anywhere, on speedsolving.com, youtube, alg.cubing.net - anywhere with a text box.

Features
[*] Move cancellation: R' R' is cancelled into R2'. R2 R is not cancelled into R3 or R' however.
[*] All 3x3 moves are supported: RUFBLDrufbldMESxyzR'U'F'B'L'D'r'u'f'b'l'd'M'E'S'x'y'z'. Type lowercase moves using the shift key.
[*] Ctrl+m inputs "[,]" and Ctrl+j "[:]", which is useful for typing commutators and conjugates. 
The keyboard shortcut ctrl + space can be used to move onto the next part of the commutator without messing up the spacing. See a demonstration here: http://gfycat.com/GentleSlushyAtlanticblackgoby

This is just a video I made to show the script in action and demonstrate its usefulness. The solve is from the first solve of this video: 7.55 Rubik's Cube Average of 12  - Drew Brads https://youtu.be/UCXyeUhjYZs

Yeah, I never got around to finishing the average. Sorry about that Drew :(

54s, 59e

I actually made a mistake on the last pair. For the fourth pair, y' U' should actually be U' y', because he did the U' first. The point of this video was to show off what this script can do though, so I'm not too worried about it. I'm not claiming it as an YTUWR or anything.
